  <h1>Samantha Loroesh</h1>
  <h2>Major: Kinesiology | Classification: Junior</h2>

  <p>
    I want to be a Pediatric Occupational Therapist because I have a passion for both children and Special Education.
    My mom has worked in the field of Special Education for many years, so I was always taught about children with
    developmental delays and disabilities and knew early on it was something I wanted to do as well. The tasks of a
    Pediatric OT focus primarily on the strengthening of fine and gross motor skills that help us perform everyday
    tasks like getting dressed, eating, or bathing. For example, some children may have trouble holding a pencil
    correctly or tying their shoes, which an Occupational Therapist can help with through therapy methods. The expected
    salary of an Occupational Therapist is over $100,000 and is consistent throughout the state.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have recently added a minor in business to my Kinesiology major because I plan to work toward opening my own
    practice for Pediatric OT one day. After I graduate OT school, I plan to work under someone for some time, but
    opening my own practice would be my real dream job. My aunt has lots of experience with entrepreneurship and would
    be a great mentor to help me achieve my goals!
  </p>

  <p>
    Right now, I am working toward finishing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Kinesiology. After I graduate, I plan to move back
    home to New Jersey and begin Occupational Therapy School. I will also begin shadowing this summer at an outpatient
    pediatric clinic to receive volunteer hours needed to apply to OT school. I will be looking for some kind of
    exercise science internship for Fall 2025, hopefully in pediatrics!
  </p>
